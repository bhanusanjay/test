* As a user, I want autocomplete and query suggestions for efficient input
* As a user, I want responses tailored to my previous searches

**1.2 Search Result Summarization**

* As a user, I want the tool to provide short, LLM-generated summaries of relevant vulnerabilities
* As a user, I want the key CVE metrics (e.g., CVSS, exploitability) highlighted in the response

**1.3 Search Filtering & Sorting**

* As a user, I want to filter semantic results by business unit, severity, or asset group
* As a user, I want to sort results based on risk score or date discovered

### Features:

**5.1 Persona-Based Experience**

* As a Red Team analyst, I want searches optimized for adversarial techniques (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK)
* As an AppSec user, I want searches contextualized to my development stack

**5.2 Training & Guided Onboarding**

* As a new user, I want a walk-through to help me understand how to use semantic search
* As a manager, I want onboarding metrics to see how my team is adopting the tool

**5.3 Success Metrics & Dashboards**

* As a program owner, I want a dashboard to track top queries, usage frequency, and satisfaction scores
* As a stakeholder, I want regular insight reports on how the tool is reducing analyst effort

If needed, I can help you create:

* **JIRA import templates**
* **Quarterly objectives aligned to these epics**
* **Dependency maps** across teams
* **OKRs per epic**

Would you like a tabular format for your PI board or help prioritizing which epics go into this quarter vs next?


Certainly! Below is a **SAFe Agile-style Epic** for an **NLP-based semantic engine** focused on **LLM-powered query resolution for application tech stack information** (e.g., frameworks, libraries, versions, dependencies).

---

## 🧠 **Epic: Enable Semantic Search for Application Tech Stack Knowledge**

**Business Outcome:**
Reduce time spent by developers, security teams, and architects in finding accurate, context-aware tech stack information by enabling natural language queries powered by LLMs.

---

### ✅ **Feature 1: Natural Language Query Resolution for App Stack**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Users can ask questions like "Which apps use Log4j?" or "What Java version is running in production?" without needing to know exact system tables or documentation structure.

**Stories:**

* As a developer, I want to ask natural language questions about app frameworks so I can focus on delivery instead of searching documentation.
* As a DevSecOps analyst, I want to query which libraries are vulnerable in our estate using everyday language.

---

### ✅ **Feature 2: Semantic Retrieval from Structured + Unstructured Sources**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
The system can retrieve context from both structured sources (CMDB, config databases) and unstructured ones (Confluence, design docs).

**Stories:**

* As a user, I want the engine to combine insights from documentation and configuration files when answering questions.
* As a platform owner, I want the source of each response to be cited and ranked by confidence.

---

### ✅ **Feature 3: Contextual Filters for Business Unit, Environment, and App Type**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Improves relevance by narrowing results using business and technical context.

**Stories:**

* As a user, I want to filter results by environment (dev/test/prod) to avoid misinterpreting configurations.
* As an enterprise architect, I want to view stack information grouped by business unit or domain.

---

### ✅ **Feature 4: Knowledge Gap Feedback Loop**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Identifies missing or outdated data in application documentation via failed or partial queries.

**Stories:**

* As a user, I want to report inaccurate or incomplete results so the system can improve.
* As a product owner, I want a dashboard of unanswered queries to prioritize documentation or data improvements.

Let me know if you'd like this turned into a **JIRA importable format**, or if you want to expand this Epic for areas like **infra stack search**, **runtime dependencies**, or **API usage analysis**.


Absolutely! Here's a **standalone functional Epic** in **SAFe Agile style** for a **Knowledge Gap Feedback Loop**, focused specifically on your **NLP-based Semantic Search Engine for the Vulnerability Knowledge Base**.

---

## 🧩 **Epic: Establish a Knowledge Gap Feedback Loop for Continuous Learning**

**Business Outcome:**
Ensure the semantic engine improves over time by capturing gaps, inaccuracies, and evolving user needs — reducing hallucinations, improving trust, and highlighting missing content in the vulnerability knowledge base.

---

### ✅ **Feature 1: Capture Unanswered or Low-Confidence Queries**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
By capturing queries the LLM struggles to answer confidently, teams can enrich the knowledge base with missing or weak content.

**Stories:**

* As a user, I want to be notified when a result is based on low-confidence data so I can cross-check manually.
* As a product owner, I want a log of failed or vague queries to identify weak coverage areas in the KB.

---

### ✅ **Feature 2: Analyst Feedback Mechanism on Search Quality**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Human-in-the-loop feedback helps reduce hallucinations and incorrect answers over time.

**Stories:**

* As an analyst, I want to mark responses as helpful or misleading so the model can learn from real-world feedback.
* As a security lead, I want visibility into the most flagged responses to drive QA and model retraining priorities.

---

### ✅ **Feature 3: Automated Data Quality & Coverage Insights**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Automatically identify stale, incomplete, or frequently-missing information in indexed documents.

**Stories:**

* As a platform engineer, I want alerts when indexed data sources are outdated or missing crucial sections (e.g., CVSS, remediation).
* As a content owner, I want a dashboard showing which vulnerability types (e.g., container-related, supply chain) lack depth in coverage.

---

### ✅ **Feature 4: Iterative Update to Prompts and Retrieval Strategy**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Adapt prompt engineering and retrieval logic to better handle real-world, evolving search intents.

**Stories:**

* As a prompt engineer, I want visibility into recurring misinterpretations of specific queries to improve prompt structure.
* As a search tuning team, I want a mechanism to experiment with updated retrieval filters based on past search feedback.
