# Employee Survey Results - Leadership Response

I appreciate the opportunity to review our recent employee survey results. Having carefully studied all the feedback and comments - both the positive recognition and constructive insights - I find this to be an invaluable learning opportunity. The feedback provides excellent perspective on our team's experience during a significant period of organizational transformation. I'd like to share my reflections on the key themes that emerged and the positive momentum we've built moving forward.

## Key Contributing Factors and Our Response

### 1. Organizational Restructuring and Role Evolution
The recent re-organization brought significant positive changes to our team structure, introducing exciting new technologies including Generative AI capabilities. During the initial transition period, team members experienced some uncertainty as we worked through new responsibility alignments and knowledge transfer processes. This temporary adjustment phase particularly affected our APAC colleagues, whose career progression timelines shifted as we optimized role assignments. I'm pleased to report that the team has now fully embraced these changes and is energized by the new technological opportunities ahead.

The organizational restructuring also resulted in a significant change for our DevOps team composition, as most in-house developed products were realigned under separate leadership, transitioning us to a more focused team structure. Simultaneously, our portfolio shifted toward vendor-based products with different deployment methodologies, which initially raised questions among team members about the evolving nature of their technical contributions and pipeline development responsibilities. However, this transformation created an exceptional opportunity to pivot toward innovation and emerging technologies. We successfully introduced cutting-edge solutions including Copilot and GenAI capabilities, which has reinvigorated the team with exciting new challenges and expanded their technical horizons. The team now embraces this evolution and is enthusiastic about the diverse opportunities and advanced skill development these new technologies provide.

### 2. Enhanced Governance Framework Implementation
Our organization's commitment to responsible AI deployment through robust Model Risk Management and AI Governance procedures demonstrates our leadership in ethical technology adoption. While our technical teams initially found the documentation requirements challenging as they adapted to these new standards, this investment in proper governance will position us as industry leaders. The team now appreciates the strategic value of these frameworks and has developed efficient processes for compliance while maintaining innovation velocity.

### 3. Product Portfolio Optimization Success
Taking ownership of GATE initially considered for decommissioning presented a unique turnaround opportunity. Through focused effort on improving client onboarding and user experience, we've successfully demonstrated the product's value proposition. What appeared to be an uncertain situation during the survey period has now transformed into a retention success story, showcasing our team's ability to revitalize and strengthen product offerings.


## Building Forward Momentum

I've invested significant time in personal engagement with team members, including overseas visits to our APAC colleagues, to ensure open communication and build strong working relationships. These conversations have been invaluable in understanding individual perspectives and aligning on our shared vision for success.

The team's current sentiment reflects genuine optimism about our future direction. We've successfully navigated the transition period, and our collective focus is now on leveraging our enhanced capabilities, improved governance framework, and strategic product portfolio to deliver exceptional results.

I'm confident that our next survey will reflect the positive transformation we've achieved and the strong foundation we've built for continued success.
