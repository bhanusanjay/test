## üîê **Epic: Enable Role-Based Access and Entitlement Control for Security Knowledge Base**

**Business Outcome:**
Ensure appropriate access to security data and semantic search responses based on user roles, functional domains (e.g., IAM, Threat Intel, Vulnerability), and data classification‚Äîsupporting least-privilege access, auditability, and domain-specific visibility.

---

### ‚úÖ **Feature 1: User Role and Domain Mapping**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Each user is mapped to one or more functional domains (e.g., IAM, Threat Intel), enabling personalized access to relevant information.

**Stories:**

* As an analyst, I want my searches to return only my domain results so I don't see content that I don't have access to.
* As an admin, I want to configure role-to-domain mappings (e.g., Threat Analyst ‚Üí Threat Intel + SIEM + Vulnerability).

---

### ‚úÖ **Feature 2: Fine-Grained Entitlement Enforcement**

**Benefit Hypothesis:**
Controls access based on content sensitivity, classification level, and domain alignment.

**Stories:**

* As a security user, I want to only see content aligned with my clearance level (e.g., Public, Proprietary, Confidential).
* As a content admin, I want to apply tagging rules to restrict access based on sensitivity and relevance.

Feature 6: User Persona/Domain Selector for Multi-Role Users
Benefit Hypothesis:
Improves experience and relevance for users with multiple roles by allowing them to select or switch active personas, ensuring accurate semantic search scoping.

Stories:

As a user with multiple roles (e.g., Penetration Tester + Threat Analyst), I want to select an active profile at login or query time so that I receive results relevant to the task I'm currently focused on.

As a user, I want the option to toggle between personas dynamically without logging out .

As an admin, I want to audit which persona was active during each query to ensure proper access enforcement.
