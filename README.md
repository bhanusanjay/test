Enhanced Analyst Productivity in Threat Detection:
Enable security analysts to make faster, more informed decisions by using GenAI to interpret signals, summarize threat intelligence, and present context-rich insights—always requiring human validation.

Accelerated Threat Hunting with AI-Augmented Hypotheses:
Support threat hunters by generating high-confidence leads and attack-path visualizations, enhancing coverage and depth while keeping analysts in control of all investigative decisions.

Precision Support in Penetration Testing Scenarios:
Assist ethical hackers by generating payload variants, suggesting misconfiguration checks, and summarizing past exploits to enrich test planning—ensuring expert oversight at every stage.

Context-Aware Access Review and IAM Governance:
Provide identity teams with natural language summaries of access patterns, peer comparisons, and risk-relevant recommendations to support access certification and policy refinement, maintaining human judgment at the core.

Informed Decision-Making in Cybercrime Monitoring:
Present condensed, GenAI-curated summaries of dark web chatter, fraud signals, and attacker TTPs, enabling threat intelligence teams to quickly assess relevance and initiate appropriate response actions.

Prioritized Vulnerability Management with Analyst Insight:
Support human-led risk assessments by correlating vulnerability metadata, asset sensitivity, and exploit narratives—offering prioritization recommendations that analysts can evaluate and act upon.

Tailored Security Awareness Campaigns:
Assist training teams in creating dynamic, role-specific awareness content (e.g., phishing simulations or scenario-based learning) grounded in recent threat trends, keeping content creation efficient yet fully human-directed.

Analyst-Focused Incident Summary Generation:
Help SOC teams contextualize and summarize incident data from multiple tools into coherent briefs, aiding human triage and response efforts without bypassing analyst validation.

Centralized and Searchable Security Knowledge Base:
Enhance security knowledge reuse by providing a GenAI-powered interface that helps analysts query internal documents, past cases, and playbooks—surfacing relevant information while keeping analysts in full control.

Executive-Ready Risk Reporting Support:
Aid cybersecurity leadership in preparing board-level reports by transforming raw data and analyst input into structured narratives—always reviewed and approved by human experts before dissemination.

Natural Language Access to Global Security Policies:
Empower associates across functions to semantically search, navigate, and understand Global Information Security Policies using GenAI interfaces that interpret natural language queries—enhancing policy awareness, reducing compliance risk, and ensuring final interpretations remain with designated policy owners
Accelerated Third-Party Security Assessment Review:
Enable risk assessors to efficiently evaluate evidence submitted by third parties in security assessments by using GenAI to interpret, summarize, and assess the relevance of uploaded documents—reducing manual effort while ensuring final validation and risk judgment remains with security experts.
