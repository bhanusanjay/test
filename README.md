While the majority of the initial team members came without prior GenAI experience, they have since been upskilled significantly across core areas including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering, LLM orchestration, and fine-tuning techniques. This has allowed us to build internal expertise while delivering against key milestones.

In parallel, we brought in 5 experienced GenAI engineers to accelerate delivery:

1 FTE in Dublin and 1 FTE in India,

3 contractors in Dublin,

Collectively, their skills span:

RAG pipelines using LangChain and LlamaIndex

Prompt templating and evaluation frameworks

Fine-tuning and parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA, QLoRA)

LLMOps and deployment workflows

Integration with enterprise APIs and data lakes

The blended team is now well-positioned to support scalable, secure, and performant GenAI product delivery.
