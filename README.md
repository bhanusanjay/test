Product Development Guiding Principle
‚ÄúBuild GenAI components only where vendor solutions don‚Äôt exist, are cost-prohibitive, or don‚Äôt integrate well with our context. Prioritize augmentation and orchestration of vendor tools rather than replication.‚Äù

‚úÖ Approach Applied in Roadmap
Develop only where tailored integration, contextual grounding, or enterprise-specific logic is required.

Where possible, orchestrate, extend, or augment vendor tools (e.g., Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike, ServiceNow, Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR, etc.).

Embed GenAI into internal processes or legacy tools where vendor coverage is weak.


| # | Threat / Risk                                                | Description of Risk                                                                                            | How GenAI Mitigates It                                                                                                                             |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Alert Fatigue & Missed Incidents**                         | Security teams are overwhelmed by thousands of low-context alerts, leading to missed real threats.             | GenAI-powered triage assistants summarize, contextualize, and prioritize alerts, reducing noise and enabling faster, more accurate response.       |
| 2 | **Slow Threat Detection & Hypothesis Generation**            | Traditional threat hunting and detection processes are manual, inconsistent, and slow.                         | GenAI helps threat hunters generate, refine, and validate hypotheses faster using patterns from past incidents, MITRE TTPs, and log data.          |
| 3 | **Inconsistent Policy & Control Understanding**              | Security policies and controls are often misunderstood, leading to compliance gaps and audit findings.         | GenAI assistants enable teams to search and interpret complex policy documents in natural language, improving clarity and alignment.               |
| 4 | **Delayed Third-Party Risk Analysis**                        | Reviewing vendor security documents is time-consuming, delaying onboarding or exposing hidden risks.           | GenAI automates the evaluation of third-party evidence, checking for relevance and alignment with controls, accelerating risk-based decisions.     |
| 5 | **Knowledge Silos & Analyst Turnover**                       | Critical security knowledge is scattered across documents, emails, and tribal memory‚Äîlost when analysts leave. | GenAI knowledge assistants centralize and democratize cyber knowledge, making it searchable, explainable, and always available to new analysts.    |
| 6 | **Inefficient Penetration Testing Workflow**                 | Pen testing teams spend excessive time on repetitive planning and documentation tasks.                         | GenAI assists with test plan creation, payload generation, and automated report summarization, freeing up experts to focus on deep technical work. |
| 7 | **Regulatory Misalignment and Interpretation Errors (LRRG)** | Misinterpretation or delayed response to changing laws and regulations can result in compliance failures.      | GenAI interprets regulatory text and maps requirements to internal controls, supporting LRRG teams with real-time, contextual compliance insights. |


Subject: Collaboration Opportunity: Ideation for 2026 GenAI Product Strategy in Cybersecurity

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I lead the GenAI Product Development team within Cybersecurity, where we focus on building AI-driven capabilities that enhance and integrate with our firm‚Äôs core security functions‚Äîincluding Cyber Threat Defense, Assurance, Cybercrime, and IAM. Over the past year, we have delivered targeted solutions that streamline threat triage, improve policy intelligence, and assist security analysts with decision-making at scale.

As we begin shaping our 2026 product strategy, we are actively seeking input from key IAM stakeholders to ensure our future GenAI capabilities are aligned with real-world challenges and opportunities across the identity landscape.

I would greatly value your perspective on potential use cases, pain points, or innovation areas where GenAI could support IAM operations, engineering, governance, or risk functions. We are especially keen to identify collaboration areas that complement existing vendor solutions while delivering differentiated internal value.

Please let me know a convenient time for a brief discussion‚Äîor feel free to share your inputs over email.

Looking forward to collaborating with you.
