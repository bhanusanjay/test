Hi [FE Engineer's Name],

Thank you for stepping in to support [Peer Dev Manager's Name]’s team on front-end development over the next four months. This product has strategic importance and timely delivery is critical – your expertise will make a real difference.

[Peer Dev Manager's Name] – please meet [FE Engineer's Name], a skilled Angular developer, a great team player, and someone who consistently goes above and beyond to support the team.

While she won’t be actively contributing to our GenAI product development during this period, I’ll keep her looped in on key updates so that when she returns, she can seamlessly resume with full context on both product and tech.

Thanks again for your support and flexibility – much appreciated.

Best regards,
