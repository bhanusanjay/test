Thank you for recognizing the need to expedite the CI/CD onboarding for our development team and setting clear timelines – your responsiveness is much appreciated.

Given the complexities around DMZ deployment, service account provisioning, and necessary permissions, I’d request you to continue closely tracking progress and raise early alarms if any risks to the timeline arise.

To the development team – please ensure timely support with product and infrastructure knowledge to help DevOps stay on course.

Let’s keep the momentum going.
