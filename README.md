## Technical Architecture Overview

### Data Flow Pipeline
```
Kafka → Flink (OCSF Transform) → Elasticsearch (Storage + Vector Store) → MongoDB (Metadata)
                ↓
OpenAI APIs (Analysis) → Dashboard (Visualization) → Threat Hunters (Action)
```

### Component Details

**Apache Flink Jobs:**
- `OCSFTransformJob`: Real-time log transformation
- `BehaviorAnalysisJob`: Continuous behavioral profiling
- `AnomalyDetectionJob`: Real-time anomaly scoring

**Elasticsearch Indices:**
- `ocsf-events`: Transformed security events
- `security-anomalies`: Detected anomalies with embeddings
- `user-behaviors`: User behavioral profiles as vectors

**MongoDB Collections:**
- `users`: User profiles and metadata
- `devices`: Device inventory and relationships  
- `query_templates`: Natural language query patterns
- `investigation_context`: Historical context for enrichment

**OpenAI Integration:**
- **GPT-4**: Query generation, summarization, field mapping
- **text-embedding-ada-002**: Behavioral analysis, similarity matching
- **Rate limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and caching

### Performance Considerations
- **Elasticsearch**: Use bulk indexing for high throughput
- **Vector Search**: Approximate nearest neighbor for real-time queries
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed embeddings
- **Batch Processing**: Process historical data in 1-hour windows

## Implementation Timeline

### Month 1: Foundation
- **Week 1-2:** Story 1 (OCSF Transformation)
- **Week 3-4:** Story 2 (Identity Graph)
- **Parallel:** Infrastructure setup, data pipeline, OpenAI integration

### Month 2: Core GenAI Features  
- **Week 1-3:** Story 3 (Natural Language Queries)
- **Week 3-4:** Story 4 (Anomaly Detection)
- **Parallel:** Elasticsearch setup, embedding pipeline

### Month 3: Integration & Demo
- **Week 1-2:** Story 5 (Context Enrichment)
- **Week 2-3:** Story 6 (Threat Summaries)
- **Week 1-4:** Story 7 (Dashboard) - parallel development
- **Week 4:** Story 8 (Demo Scenarios & Validation)

## Team Allocation (6 Developers)

**Backend/Data (3 developers):**
- Data pipeline and OCSF transformation
- Elasticsearch integration and query generation
- ML/embedding pipeline for anomaly detection

**AI/GenAI (2 developers):**
- OpenAI API integration and prompt engineering
- RAG implementation for context enrichment
- Natural language processing and summary generation

**Frontend/Integration (1 developer):**
- Dashboard development
- API integration and user interface
- Demo preparation and validation scenarios

## Success Metrics (Prototype Quality)

**Technical:**
- Transform 1000+ log entries to OCSF format
- Generate 10+ query types from natural language
- Detect 5+ anomaly types with reasonable accuracy
- Response time <5 seconds for interactive queries

**Demonstration:**
- 5 complete demo scenarios working end-to-end
- Clear before/after comparison showing GenAI value
- Stakeholder-ready presentation materials
- Documentation for future development phases

## Key Prototype Limitations
- Static data only (no real-time processing)
- Limited to 10 query types and 5 anomaly types
- Basic UI focused on demo rather than production use
- No advanced ML optimization or model training
- Simplified error handling and monitoring

This scope provides a realistic 3-month prototype that demonstrates core GenAI capabilities while being achievable with your team size.

Document ∙ Version 3 
I've added detailed technical implementation guidance for each story using your specific tech stack. Here are the key technical approaches:

Core Architecture:

Flink: Real-time stream processing for OCSF transformation and behavioral analysis
Elasticsearch: Both traditional search and vector store for embeddings
MongoDB: Metadata, user profiles, and relationship storage
OpenAI APIs: GPT-4 for query generation/summarization, embeddings for similarity matching
Key Technical Patterns:

OCSF Transformation: Flink streaming jobs with GPT-4 validation for ambiguous field mappings
Identity Linking: Text embeddings + cosine similarity stored in MongoDB (no graph database needed)
Natural Language Queries: Few-shot prompting with GPT-4 to generate Elasticsearch DSL queries
Anomaly Detection: Behavioral embeddings compared via vector similarity in Elasticsearch
RAG Context: Semantic search in Elasticsearch vector store combined with MongoDB aggregations
Dashboard: FastAPI backend with WebSocket real-time updates and React frontend
Practical Implementation Notes:

Code examples show realistic integration patterns
Emphasis on prototype-quality vs production optimization
Specific handling for your data sources (Kafka, Splunk access)
Validation framework for demo scenarios
This gives your developers concrete technical guidance while staying within the 3-month prototype scope.
