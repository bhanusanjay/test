Opening & Context Setting
"I'm Ricardo, leading our Singapore-based GenAI cybersecurity team and serving as tech lead for our flagship PenPal assistant platform. Having transitioned from EMEA operations a year ago, I've been focused on establishing our APAC cybersecurity AI capabilities and leveraging the exceptional talent pool across this region."
Core Platform Overview
"We're building a comprehensive Cyber GenAI Platform that's transforming how our security teams operate globally. This platform combines on-premises open-source LLMs running on our AI HPC infrastructure with Azure-hosted OpenAI APIs, giving us both control and cutting-edge capabilities."
"The platform delivers four core capabilities: NLP-based semantic search across our security data lakes, intelligent summarization of threat intelligence, automated content generation for security documentation, and GenAI-augmented data analysis that's revolutionizing how we interpret security events."
Technical Innovation & Methodology
"Our architecture leverages advanced methodologies including RAG for contextual information retrieval, sophisticated tool calling for automated security workflows, Model Context Protocol for seamless AI integration, robust guardrails for security compliance, and targeted fine-tuning for cybersecurity-specific use cases."
APAC Team Value Proposition
"The APAC and India talent pool has been instrumental in this platform's development. Our distributed team brings deep technical expertise in AI/ML, combined with around-the-clock development cycles that accelerate our delivery. The cost-effectiveness and technical depth available in this region allows us to compete with any global AI initiative."
Flagship Product: PenPal
"PenPal, our GenAI assistant for penetration testers, exemplifies our platform's potential. It's reducing testing time by 40% while improving coverage quality. This success story demonstrates how APAC-developed solutions can drive global cybersecurity value."
Regional Growth Vision (Subtle)
"We're seeing strong demand signals across APAC for these capabilities. The region's digital transformation pace creates unique opportunities for cybersecurity AI applications. Our current Singapore hub positions us well to support regional expansion as business cases mature."
Competitive Advantage
"Our hybrid cloud-on-premises approach addresses regulatory requirements across APAC markets while maintaining the agility to leverage latest commercial models. This architectural decision, driven by our APAC team's understanding of regional compliance needs, differentiates us from purely cloud-based competitors."
Closing Value Statement
"We're not just building AI tools â€“ we're creating a platform that scales cybersecurity expertise globally while being developed and refined by world-class APAC talent. The early success metrics and stakeholder feedback position us for significant expansion of both capabilities and team size."
